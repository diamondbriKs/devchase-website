            <h1>Welcome to Devchase - LAH 2018</h1>
            <h3><em>The Twilio based social experience</em></h3>
            <br>
            <h4>What even is this?</h4>
            <p>Devchase is a game hosted through Twilio, an API for sending SMS and MMS text messages. The game works on the concept of finding a person from an image sent to you, and exchanging a keyword to score a point. <strike>The players with the highest number of points are displayed on the leaderboard.</strike>(wip)</p>
            <h4>That sounds fun! How do I play?</h4>
            <p>To play, text "start" to <strong>(408) 809 1018</strong> and follow the instructions sent to you. Then you can then type "queue" to find a person to match with. Your pictures will be exchanged, and you will each be given a keyword. From here you will walk (yes, physically walk) around the venue and look for each other. When you find each other, and you send each other's keywords to the server, you will both be awarded a point. From here, you can either start a conversation, or you can find a new partner by typing queue again. If you cannot  find your partner after a while of searching, you can type "queue" again to re-enter the queue. The "clear" command will reset your account. </p>
            <h4>Commands for reference:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start</strong> - creates your account with your phone number </li>
                <li><strong>Queue</strong> - puts you into a queue to match with a partner </li>
                <li><strong>Clear</strong> - removes your account from database</li>
            </ul>
