            <h3>The Twilio based social experience</h3>
            <h4>What even is this?</h4>
            <p>Devchase is game hosted through Twilio, an API for sending SMS and MMS text messages. The game works on the concept of finding a person from an image sent to you, and exchanging a keyword to score a point. The players with the highest number of points are displayed on the leaderboard. Also, if you care about making friends, you are given a conversation topic to talk about.</p>
            <h4>That sounds fun! How do I play?</h4>
            <p>To play, start by texting "start" to [REDACTED]. Then follow the instructions sent to you. Then you can type "queue" to find a person to match with. Your pictures will be exchanged, and you will each be given a keyword. From here you will walk (yes, physically walk) around the venue and look for each other. When you find each other, and you send each other's keywords to the server, you will both be awarded a point. From here, you can either start a conversation with the given topic, or you can find a new partner.</p>
